1. Find Vcmax and Jmax values for crop species (literature or experiments)

2. Use Jmax_adj to find the optimal Vmax (trying out different values to ascertain which gives lowest SSR) - then substitute this value into Vcmax_adj.m

3. Use Vcmax_adj.m to obtain optimal VRubisco (which gives lowest SSR)

4. Run optimization for Cc=129 ppm using gpmain.m, setting VRubisco and Vmax to optimal values found using parameterisation step 
(or edit Einput and set these both as 1 in gpmain)

5. BestMatrix gives the optimal distribution of Vmax values for 67 photosynthetic enzymes (V1-V59)

6. dplot gives change in metabolite concentrations (needs to reach steady state towards end of optimisation)
