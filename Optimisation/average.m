% average.m     This function calculate the average of Vmax for each generation. 

function ave = average(pop,popSize)

global VmaxNum;

poptemp = pop';
AVGM = zeros(1,VmaxNum + 2);

for m = 2: VmaxNum + 2;
    AVGM(m) = sum(poptemp(:,m))/popSize;
end

ave = AVGM;

% *Faster rewrite suggested - check this works
% ave = mean(pop,2)
% ave(1) = 0;
% ave=reshape(ave,[1,size(ave,1)]);
